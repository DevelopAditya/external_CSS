<h1>Famous Computer Viruses</h1><br><br>
<h3>Code Red</h3><br>
<p>Code Red was a computer worm observed on the Internet on July 15, 2001. It attacked computers running Microsoft's IIS web server. The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh when it exploited a vulnerability discovered by Riley Hassell. They named it "Code Red" because Code Red Mountain Dew was what they were drinking at the time. Although the worm had been released on July 13, the largest group of infected computers was seen on July 19, 2001. On this day, the number of infected hosts reached 359,000.The worm showed a vulnerability in the growing software distributed with IIS, described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-033, for which a patch had been available a month earlier. The worm spread itself using a common type of vulnerability known as a buffer overflow. It did this by using a long string of the repeated letter 'N' to overflow a buffer, allowing the worm to execute arbitrary code and infect the machine with the worm. Kenneth D. Eichman was the first to discover how to block it, and was invited to the White House for his discovery.On August 4, 2001, Code Red II appeared. Although it used the same injection vector, it had a completely different payload. It pseudo-randomly chose targets on the same or different subnets as the infected machines according to a fixed probability distribution, favoring targets on its own subnet more often than not. Additionally, it used the pattern of repeating 'X' characters instead of 'N' characters to overflow the buffer.If the worm is once again injected into the Internet, it can only affect computers that still have the vulnerability on the Web server. Previously infected computers can be re-infected if they have not been patched. Symantec Security Response advises users of IIS4.0 and 5.0 to apply the Microsoft patch before August 1. Security Response will continue to monitor CodeRed activities on the Internet and will post updates to this page when available.</p><br><br>
<h3>Nimda</h3><br>
<p>First appearing on September 18, 2001, Nimda is a computer virus that caused traffic slowdowns as it rippled across the Internet, spreading through four different methods, infecting computers containing Microsoft's Web server, Internet Information Server (IIS), and computer users who opened an e-mail attachment. Like a number of predecessor viruses, Nimda's payload appears to be the traffic slowdown itself - that is, it does not appear to destroy files or cause harm other than the considerable time that may be lost to the slowing or loss of traffic known as denial-of-service and the restoring of infected systems. With its multi-pronged attack, Nimda appears to be the most troublesome virus of its type that has yet appeared. Its name (backwards for "admin") apparently refers to an "admin.dll" file that, when run, continues to propagate the virus.Nimda was so effective partially because it—unlike other malware like the Morris worm or Code Red—uses five different infection vectors: Email, Open network shares,
Browsing of compromised web sites, exploitation of various Internet Information Services (IIS) 4.0 / 5.0 directory traversal vulnerabilities. (Both Code Red and Nimda were hugely successful exploiting well known and long solved vulnerabilities in the Microsoft IIS Server.),Back doors left behind by the "Code Red II" and "sadmind/IIS" worms.</p><br><br>
<h3>SirCam</h3><br>
<p>SirCam is a computer worm that first propagated in 2001 by e-mail in Microsoft Windows systems. It began with one of the following lines of text and had an attachment consisting of the worm's executable with some file from the infected computer appended:</p>
<OL>
<LI>I send you this file in order to have your advice
<LI>I hope you like the file that I sendo you
<LI>I hope you can help me with this file that I send
<LI>This is the file with the information you ask for
<LI>Te mando este archivo para que me des tu punto de vista (in spanish)
<LI>Espero te guste este archivo que te mando (in spanish)
<LI>Espero me puedas ayudar con el archivo que te mando (in spanish)
<LI>Este es el archivo con la informacion que me pediste (in spanish)
</OL>
<p>Due to a bug in the worm, the message was rarely sent in any form other than "I send you this file in order to have your advice." This subsequently became an in-joke among those who were using the Internet at the time, and were spammed with e-mails containing this string sent by the worm. It affected computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me (Millennium). Sircam was notable during its outbreak for the way it distributed itself. Document files (usually .doc or .xls) on the infected computer were chosen at random, infected with the virus and emailed out to email addresses in the host's address book. Opening the infected file resulted in infection of the target computer. During the outbreak, many personal or private files were emailed to people who otherwise should not have received them. It could also spread via open shares on a network. Sircam scanned the network for computers with shared drives and copied itself to a machine with an open (non-password protected) drive or directory. A simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) was then executed to start the process on the target machine, usually unknown to the owner of the now-compromised computer. Over a year after the initial 2001 outbreak, Sircam was still in the top 10 on virus charts.</p><br><br>
<h3>Melissa</h3><br>
<p>Melissa is a fast-spreading macro virus that is distributed as an e-mail attachment that, when opened, disables a number of safeguards in Word 97 or Word 2000, and, if the user has the Microsoft Outlook e-mail program, causes the virus to be resent to the first 50 people in each of the user's address books. While it does not destroy files or other resources, Melissa has the potential to disable corporate and other mail servers as the ripple of e-mail distribution becomes a much larger wave. On Friday, March 26, 1999, Melissa caused the Microsoft Corporation to shut down incoming e-mail. Intel and other companies also reported being affected. The U. S. Department of Defense-funded Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) issued a warning about the virus.The original Melissa increased the overall burden on email servers every time it infected a new user and eventually resulted in server overload, turning Melissa into a denial of service (DOS) attack. Most of the damages associated with Melissa were the result of lost productivity while email servers were down.After a lengthy trial process, Smith lost his case and received a 20-month jail sentence. The court also fined Smith $5,000 and forbade him from accessing computer networks without court authorization [source: BBC]. Ultimately, the Melissa virus didn't cripple the Internet, but it was one of the first computer viruses to get the public's attention.</p><br><br>
<h3>Ripper</h3><br>
<p>Ripper is a virus that randomly corrupts disk writes when active in memory. Approximately 1 in every 1,000 disk writes is affected, making the information written invalid. Ripper infects floppy disk boot records and hard disk Master Boot Records (MBRs). The virus is encrypted with a variable key, which is quite rare among boot sector viruses. Symptoms of this virus are:</p>
<OL>
<LI>Computer will start behaving unpredictably
<LI>You will receive unexpected operating system error messages
<LI>BSoD Errors in Windows
<LI>Slow computer performance
<LI>Programs will display “Not Responding” error messages
<LI>Blue screen errors in Windows
<LI>New files getting created at the root-level of a hard drive
<LI>Spam messages unknowingly being sent from your email account
<LI>Mysterious files and folder deletions
</OL><br>
<h3>MDMA virus</h3><br>
<P>This virus spreads by attaching its code to other files on your PC or network. Some of the infected programs might no longer run correctly.This virus infects Word documents, templates and the NORMAL.DOT file of Word 6 and Word for Windows 95. The virus code is contained in one macro named "AutoClose". The virus code is encrypted. MDMA virus has a dangerous payload. When the first infected document is opened by Word the virus gets control and it checks whether the Global Template file (NORMAL.DOT) is infected. If it is not infected then the virus copies its macros to NORMAL.DOT and there by infecting it. Then onwards the virus will be infecting all the new document files created in that computer.The virus will activate its destructive code and the destriction done will vary according to the operating system. In Windows 95 the virus will delete all the Control Panel (CPL) and Help (HLP) files in the Windows directory. The virus will also make some changes to the Windows Registry affecting the Logon, Display and Keyboard settings. In Windows NT the virus will delete all files in the current directory. Under Windows 3.x the virus will add a line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that all files in the C drive will be deleted the next time the computer is switched on. MDMA virus first appeared in 1996 and it is in the wild. MDMA has several variants. They differ from the first virus in the message box content and the date of activation. This worm is also known as WM/Mdma, Word.Mdma, Stickykeys and SHMK.</p><br><br>
<h3>WM.Concept</h3><br>
<p>WM/Concept.A is the first widely known Word macro virus written for Microsoft Word 6. This virus infects Microsoft Word files. When an infected document is first loaded, a dialogue box titled "Microsoft Word", containing the string "1" and an OK button, pops up. Concept was the first widespread macro virus. This virus that uses five macros to infect hosts and spread itself. The macros are named:</p>
<OL>
<LI>AAAZAO
<LI>AAAZFS
<LI>AutoOpen
<LI>FileSaveAs
<LI>PayLoad
</OL>
<p>In Word's Global Template NORMAL.DOT. the virus becomes active by using Auto- and SystemMacros. All macros are encrypted using the standard Word execute-only feature. Meaning that the user is unable to edit or view the macro code. The virus makes use of the well-developed macro language, Word Basic, in an attempt to exploit the fact that computer users exchange documents far more often than programs. After this, every document saved using the File|SaveAs is infected with the virus. This normally happens when a newly-created document is saved to disk. WM.Concept virus is a very common 'in the wild' virus. This is largely due to Microsoft accidentally shipping it on a CD ROM called Microsoft Windows 95 Software Compatability Test to hundreds of OEM companies, in August 1995. Another company distributed more WM.Concept-infected documents on 5,500 copies of a CD ROM called Snap-on Tools for Windows NT shortly afterwards.</p><br><br>
<h3>One_Half</h3><br>
<p>OneHalf is a DOS-based polymorphic computer virus (hybrid boot and file infector) discovered in October 1994. It is also known as Slovak Bomber, Freelove or Explosion-II. It infects the master boot record (MBR) of the hard disk, and any files with extensions .COM, .SCR and .EXE. However, it will not infect files that have SCAN, CLEAN, FINDVIRU, GUARD, NOD, VSAFE, MSAV or CHKDSK in the name. It is also known as one of the first viruses to implement a technique of "patchy infection", introduced in Bomber. OneHalf has about 20 different variants, all with functionally similar behaviour. OneHalf is known for its peculiar payload: at every boot, it encrypts two unencrypted cylinders of the user's Hard disk, but then temporarily decrypts them when they are accessed. This makes sure the user does not notice that their hard disk is being encrypted like this, and lets the encryption continue further. It also hides the real MBR from programs on the computer, to make detection harder. The encryption is done by bitwise XORing by a randomly generated key, which can be decrypted simply by XORing with the same bit stream again. OneHalf's unique payload makes removal harder: simply removing the virus and cleaning the MBR will leave the data encrypted, requiring backups to restore it. As such, special tools are needed to decrypt the hard disk before removing the virus. One such tool was developed for SAC (Slovak Antivirus Center) to do this job.</p>
